I have been on a Keto diet for one week, here's what I've experienced...
I am 200lbs and 6'1, on paper I could be The Rock, I mean I kind of am, except for the love handles and beer belly (oh, and I don't have muscles either). I'm sort of like a sculpture - an unfinished one of course, lot's of chunks in random spots that haven't been removed.

So let's try out this Keto thing... Bikini season is around the corner after all.

&#x200B;

140g fat / 120g protein / 15g carbs / 1700 calories.

&#x200B;

\*\*Day 1:\*\* 1700 calories? Yea, OK. That wasn't going to happen. No matter how much I ate I never felt "full". I had this empty stomach feeling, I need carbs, man! If I were to guess, I would imagine I consumed 3,000+ calories on average before the diet. I mean, I would eat literal trash (a lot of trash), and then soak it down with 3-4 pints in the evening (on a Monday, let's not get into the weekend...).

&#x200B;

\*\*Day 2:\*\* I have superhuman keto placebo! I am invincible! Ultra focused, uncontrollable energy, either avocado contains adderall or I'm in ketosis baby! The superiority kicks in, I start referring to friends and family as carbavours, I walk around the mall and think "I'm surrounded by carb eating zombies...". This is the new me, for sure.

&#x200B;

\*\*Day 3:\*\* Well, that didn't last long... I'd consider it a crash, or a train wreck, but most would consider it karma. I spent  most of this day on the couch, wallowing. I wasn't sure if I was hungry or dying - no matter what I ate the shakes persisted.

&#x200B;

\*\*Day 4:\*\* This isn't too bad, I feel a little better, but am I high!? People around me kept asking "why is he being so nice?" or "he needs to eat something, look at him!" Yes, I was dazed, but no munchies! For the first time I didn't feel like I had an appetite...

&#x200B;

\*\*Day 5:\*\* I think I feel normal, perhaps, what is normal? Who am I? Shit, maybe I'm not normal... Speaking of shit, what is that? I hardly remember... Oh, you mean that black stuff? Am I supposed to see a doctor!? Well, at least the insomnia  subsided.

&#x200B;

\*\*Day 6:\*\* The desire for food is 100% gone, I don't even want to eat, I never thought that would happen... I'm all wrapped up in this keto life, I almost forgot I'm a hoser from the north eh, and tonight the fuckin' Leafs play the fuckin' Nucks bud, and that means crackin' a few coldies with the boys. But look's like I'm in luck, I found some local craft piss-water that's only 1.5 carbs, and a salty bag of pork rinds.

&#x200B;

\*\*Day 7:\*\* Well, that's today, should I have posted this tomorrow maybe? What do you want from me!? I think I lost 4-5lbs so that's something. I made this account around day 3, "aketojourney"? Really? It's clear my cognitive function has improved, but perhaps not my energy since I'm too lazy to make a different user.
b'This is hilarious writing! I love it! Keep up ketoing! (And do write more status updates!)'b'> unfinished sculpture\n\nIs this you ? \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/22ocndI.jpg\n\nKCKO.\n\nVodka Water has zero carbs.\n\n'b'Love it. Very funny. But I hope you read about electrolytes or your next post is going to be about your massive headache. 'b"Can you please write a blog or create an instagram with your daily progress cos I legit lol'd. Thanks and welcome!!"b"As a fellow 6'1er who's thinking of Keto, I want more weekly updates of your journey. "b"I love this!\n\nFor me, when I started keto, I gave myself a 'free pass' on calories for the first week or two. This helped me through adaptation and getting started.\n\nDefinitely was easier to drop calories significantly once was in the groove.\n\nKeto is a lifestyle, so I focus on the big goal of keeping it up for years."b"Wha craft piss-water ya drinkin' der bud?\n\nGo Leafs!"b'Hah.. "carbavores".\n\nIm a few months in and still adapting. I mean im in ketosis but my body and my habits are still settling in to a new rhythm. Its a "journey" though for sure.'b"You're funny. \xf0\x9f\x98\x86\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d"b'The accuracy here! Lmao'b'Lol same here 1 week experienced the same first two-three days were rough had to fight through it since i was used to eat a lot. After a week im nit even hungry anymore its insane. I eat because i want to consume daily fats and protein + i enjoy cooking and experimenting with keto, whole new world:)'b'Thank you for the truthful entertaining post! 'b'A sense of humor can help so much. Good for you. Keep posting your updates. Keeps you accountable. And entertains & inspires!'b'I concur, please narrate your adventure. This is hilarious \xf0\x9f\x98\x82'b'Did you suffer any keto flu or electrolyte imbalance...if yes.how did.u managed it'b' hilarious  love it!!!'b"Being on keto and walking around a grocery store or the mall food court definitely makes you think everyone else is a blind carb junkie looking for their next fix. Like how do they not see it? All the carbs are turning into sugar in their bodies. They're addicts"b'I had your Day 2 as well...I think (for me, at least, being likely pre-diabetic) it was my body\'s relief at not being awash in insulin for a full 24-hour period! Dropping bread and sugar was the best thing ever.\n\nAlso, feeling your appetite flatline and getting new and improved "true" hunger signals is great!'b"Love your writing! Can't wait seeing your weekly update:)"b'Wait wait wait say that last part again'b"Here in BC we have a beer called [PrimeTime](https://i.redd.it/8a859bi6rve21.jpg). It's OK. It really puts the pale in ale. When your piss comes out darker than the beer you know it's meh. But I'm not one to pass up a 5% beverage. \n\n> Go Leafs!\n\nYou're lucky I'm still glowing from last night's win. Go Canucks! "b'hrm...might just stick to Mich Ultra...even the look of that can is wrong...\n\nYeah that was a disappointment for me...hate staying up later than usual for a loss!  '
